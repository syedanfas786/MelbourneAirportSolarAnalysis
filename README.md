# Melbourne Airport Solar Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset from Melbourne Airport that includes solar and environmental data. The aim is to apply various data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, Bayesian inference, and clustering to extract insights from the data. Key analyses include wind speed distribution, temperature-humidity relationship, categorical probability estimation, and clustering of data points.

## Files Included
- `MelbAirportSolarData.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `Syed-Anfas-Ahmed.R  The main R script containing the code for the analysis and visualizations.
- `Syed-Anfas-Ahmed-MelbAirSolarMyData.txt`: A subset of the sampled data.
- `lettersdata.txt`: Data used for clustering analysis.

## Key Analyses

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms and box plots to visualize the wind speed distribution.
- Scatter plot and linear regression to explore the relationship between temperature and humidity.
- Five-number summary and descriptive statistics for wind speed.

### 2. Probability Estimation and Independence Testing
- Conditional probability calculations for wind speed, temperature, and irradiance categories.
- Cross-tabulation and conditional probability tests to check for mutual exclusivity.

### 3. Bayesian Analysis
- Prior and posterior distributions for height data using normal distribution assumptions.
- Likelihood and Bayesian updating visualized with custom density functions.

### 4. Clustering
- K-means clustering to group data points based on dimensional attributes.
- Spectral clustering to explore alternative clustering methods.
- Elbow method used to determine the optimal number of clusters based on TOTWSS.
